== Current State
The current codebase is an artifact that seeks to achieve @merlin_domain_model (High speed particle simulation).
The code has an accidental architecture as an ad-hoc feature development approach meant that the only concrete factor was the tech stack(@merlin_tech_stack).
@merlin_codescene_maintainability_circle is a clear example of the outcome of this, a jumbled mess of code is mashed together.


While successful in achieving functionality the code architecture makes change difficult and has slowed the potential development of features due to the complexity of adding new features.
This architecture is something that will not last in the long term and a purpose picked architecture is needed to support the l:wqong running development and maintenance of the project in future.


== Proposed Architecture
To address these issues, looking at the Merlin documentation highlights the two key architectural goals the project had in development; to do the job in the simplest form and to produce a set of loosely coupled components which are easily maintainable (@appleby_merlin_2022).
These goals along with the core purpose of the system being simulation leads me to believe that a microkernel architecture is the best architecture for this project.
A microkernel architecture is a system built around a single purpose, in this case simulation while allowing a plugin system to introduce new functionality without changing the core code @rana_survey_2023.

#figure(image("./images/2025-10-23-14:21:46.png"),
caption: [MicroKernel Architecture Diagram])



The advantages this brings are numerous:
- The core code being largely static encourages *testability* and *robustness* as a set of comprehensive tests to be developed and maintained.
- Removing the plugins from the core developer responsibilities improves *maintainability* as only the core code must be maintained.
- The plugin system allows for development *flexibility*, allowing new features without changing the core code. Opening the code to extensibility without the new features encroaching on the core simulation.

== Reasoning
This re-architecture is feasible due to the big shutdown happening to Merlin.
As just fixing the code is a monumental task, seen here @merlin_technical_debt_cost.
To take full advantage of the shutdown I propose to rewrite the codebase in Rust.

Adopting a microkernel architecture would provide a stable testable core, while rust would optimise the performance and robustness of the simulation, integral to high precision simulations.
These changes would improve the long term maintainability of the code, as well as preventing unsafe code from entering the codebase.

Additionally, Rust inherently supports the functional programming paradigm, which I believe is well placed in the plugin-based architecture.
If plugins are enforced to be functional, they will act as stateless modules interacting through interfaces, reducing the risk of architectural drift as a plugin with state could become a dependency (CITE HERE).
Merlin can then maintain clear separation between the stable simulation kernel and user-developed extensions, ensuring long-term scalability and maintainability while allowing feature flexibility.


== Conclusion
This architecture proposal aligns with the ideal goals Merlin had laid out (CITE HERE).
Allow new developers to merlin focus on new features to develop over jumping around spaghetti code trying to understand issues.
Shifting the focus from maintenance and compiling being the standard to a robust performant system being at the core of Merlin.

== Tech Stack

#figure(
  image("images/ffea/tech_stack.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [Tech Stack]
)
The tech stack is primarily focused on C++, the processing and the simulations are all carried out in C++, this is a natural choice as performance is a tenant of the program. The visualisations build on the PyMol library with a plugin. This leads to a natural decoupling where visualisation is separated from processing. This is a suitable tech stack for the project allow for a modular approach and follwing the qualities required for the project.

== Use Case Diagram
#figure(

  image("images/ffea/Use_case.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [Use Case Diagrams]
)
The primary use case for FFEA is to process protein files to then simulate under user desired conditions. The interface is rudimentary in terms of use as the complexity lies in both the simulation and parameters which means that a simple process still has layers of complexity. Looking at the use case there could be an argument to bundle the tooling as the whole purpose of ffeatools is to prepare files for ffea meaning a single unified process that processes then displays based on cli arguments would streamline the process.



== Utility Tree
#figure(
  image("images/ffea/utility_tree.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [Utility Tree]
)
The utility tree is quite idealistic of aspirational long term goals of the project. There is a heavy focus on maintainability as that must be a tenant of the software for the longevity of the project and research. The maintainability goals have been selected as the foundational work needed in terms of refactoring to move the project to a useable state before any new features are added. 

Testability is primarily focused on having a robust test suite to test against to allow simpler refactoring. The goal of 100% test coverage is lofty but a necessary requirement to allow for refactoring with confidence.

Performance is a tenant that is key to the project through the functional requirements but in terms of ilities it is much harder to focus non fucntional requirements through that lens as the testable performance is not easily described.

Useability is targeted towards allowing this tool to be run anywhere regardless of OS as Windows is not supported now but docker can resilve this. THe tool must allow for users to interact with it without needing the wiki to see the help commands and simple processing as well to allow for easier and more vaired user testing and feedback.

== SysML Diagram
#figure(
  image("images/ffea/sysMl.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [SysML Diagram]
)
The SysML diagram highlights the standout requirements of the tool to allow for accurate protein simulations to be done with respect to user input. There are undoubtedly many more functional requirements but assuming the simulations as primarily a black box the requirements centre around accurate simulations to be done and visualised based on the user configuration allowing for the correct interactions to be observed. The requirements are broken into three large logical sections being the processing, simulating and visualing. This SysML structure allows for room for growth as more requirements are discovered.


== Codesense Diagram
#figure(
  image("images/ffea/codesense_architecture.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [Codesense Architecture Diagram]
)
This digram highlights three key things about the architecture decisions taken for this project. The first feature being the flat structure taken for src, this means that all files are the same level and there is no logical grouping for any of the src files which makes grouping much more difficult. The is in spite of the fact that the test files are very well structured.

This leads into the second point of the severe size difference in size between tests and src, this signifies a significant amount of the code is untested making it much more difficult to add to the codebase with confidence.

Lastly looking at the colours of the larger files three files are exceptionally difficult to modify and maintain, again a major hit to maintainability
