	abstract = {Merlin++ is a C++ charged-particle tracking library developed for the simulation and analysis of complex beam dynamics within high energy particle accelerators. Accurate simulation and analysis of particle dynamics is an essential part of the design of new particle accelerators, and for the optimization of existing ones. Merlin++ is a feature-full library with focus on long-term tracking studies. A user may simulate distributions of protons or electrons in either single particle or sliced macro-particle bunches. The tracking code includes both straight and curvilinear coordinate systems allowing for the simulation of either linear or circular accelerator lattice designs, and uses a fast and accurate explicit symplectic integrator. Physics processes for common design studies have been implemented, including {RF} cavity acceleration, synchrotron radiation damping, on-line physical aperture checks and collimation, proton scattering, wakefield simulation, and spin-tracking. Merlin++ was written using C++ object orientated design practices and has been optimized for speed using multicore processors. This article presents an account of the program, including its functionality and guidance for use.

	title = {A Survey on Microkernel Based Operating Systems and Their Essential Key Components},
	abstract = {In a conventional monolithic operating system architecture, the kernel delivers all the necessary services to the application programs. As the requirements of the operating system increase, the kernel expands in size and increases complexity. The introduction of Operating Systems ({OSs}) focusing on Microkernels was due to the difficulties mentioned above caused by Operating Systems with Monolithic kernels. Operating systems based on microkernels offer enhanced security and flexibility to the system. This research presents an in-depth review of eleven unique operating systems based on a microkernel architecture. The study focuses on three key factors: inter-process communication ({IPC}), memory management, and process scheduling. This review offers insights into the various trends observed in the design of Microkernel Based Operating Systems. The data sources included books, research papers, and official documentation of individual microkernels.},
